# Calccode:

The Calccode project was an idea I had to remember concepts that I might have forgotten during a period of time that I didn't code.

The idea was to create a login and registration screen, for the user to enter or register on the website, as soon as they enter there would be a brief presentation of the company, a page with the link to the website's repository, and another page with a calculator that
would calculate the sales profit that such a person or company had in the year or years that would be calculated.

A very simple idea focused on training concepts that I had learned.
