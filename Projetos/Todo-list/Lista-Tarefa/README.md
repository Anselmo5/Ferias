Task List:
This project was created with the aim of carrying out a task given to me through a react course, which consisted of creating an http request also using a form of exclusion of this method itself after execution.

With this in mind I decided to make a list of tasks that demonstrates this being carried out in practice.

Note: besides being a good way to execute this idea and to-do list, it was already an old project that I wanted to do
